  Writing and submitting a project plan is the first step, when
  beginning your MSc/BSc project. However, there is not a lot of
  official guidance provided by DTU about how to specifically set up and
  write a good project plan. In this document, we will try to provide
  tips and tricks for writing a plan, including which elements to
  include, how to set up and formulate research questions, and how to
  scope your time schedule.

# Why having a project plan is a good idea

The project plan is the first major document you will be writing during
your thesis work, and it is to be submitted approximately one month
after starting. Although it is not as long or detailed as your thesis
will be, it is still a good idea to take some time into making sure the
project plan is thorough. Apart from being an official requirement by
DTU, you should think of the project plan as a way to align the
expectations of yourself and your supervisor(s), as well as any
potential collaborators. It is also an excellent opportunity for you to
really dive in to the subject and *condense* the subject matter into
formalized investigation points or *research questions*.

A good project plan should be short (2-3 pages), concise, and could
ideally serve as a first draft of the *Introduction* in your thesis.

# What to include in your project plan

Formally, the project plan should include (at least) these sections:

1.  **Introduction**,

2.  **Research questions**,

3.  **MSc/BSc learning objectives**,

4.  **Time schedule**, and

5.  **References**

The specific content of these section is detailed below. It should be
noted that this is a *sufficient*, not *necessary*, list.

## Introduction

This section could also be called *Project description* or *Motivating
background*, and it is where the majority of the text body will be.
While this may vary across disciplines and departments, the contents in
this section could ideally be contained in three paragraphs.

The first will introduce and elaborate on the underlying problem that
you are trying to solve. Think of it as a way to introduce an unfamiliar
reader to the topic and make them understand why this is interesting or
important.

The second paragraph will describe at a high level the ways that this
problem has been investigated previously in related work by others. This
should not be too technical, so don't go into details about model
architectures, hyperparameters etc. Try to find a balance, such that a
new reader will get the feel for the state of the art, and such that you
yourself can remember related work.

The third paragraph should contain a brief description of what your
project will do to solve the problem introduced in the first paragraph.
Think of ways to describe your method, algorithm, model or similar, in a
way that emphasizes how it is different and/or novel.

## Research questions

## MSc/BSc learning objectives

The following items are the specific BSc learning objectives, which has
to be included in the project plan.

## Time schedule

A larger project will typically contain specific phases, during which
certain tasks are to be completed. For instance, the first couple of
weeks will typically be spent on familiarizing yourself with relevant
literature and reading tons of papers, while the last couple of weeks
will be spent entirely focused on writing your thesis. In between these
periods might be weeks dedicated to data collection, exploratory
analysis, model development, testing and validation, and result
analysis, and these typically follow an ordering of sorts. This section
should be used to showcase the project structure from initiation to
final submission.

Typically, this is realized using a Gantt chart[^1], which is a
convenient way to structure a project into specific tasks spanning
across time slots, and deadlines.

## References

It is important to back up the descriptive text in *Introduction* with
references to literature, and this section will contain an itemized list
of any cited papers, documents, books, and similar.
